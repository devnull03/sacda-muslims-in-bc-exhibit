          The South Asian Muslims in British Columbia digital exhibit sheds
          light on the often obscured and misrepresented historical and
          contemporary presence of Muslim communities in Canada, focusing on
          South Asian Muslim communities of B.C. Through archival records,
          academic works, and personal interviews, we aim to highlight their
          profound contributions to Canadian society and promote deeper
          appreciation and understanding.
