      name: "Husain Rahim",
      years: "(1865-1937)",

            Husain Rahim came from a Gujarati Hindu family and came to Canada
            as a tourist in 1910. Five months after his arrival, the immigration
            department started the procedure for deportation against him.
            However, Rahim fought the case and won it in court thereby,
            remaining in Vancouver.
            <br /><br />
            In 1911, Rahim established the United India League, an organization focused
            on employing constitutional methods to stimulate social and political
            renewal within the Hindustanee populace.
            <br /><br />
            In 1914 when the Komagata Maru incident occurred, Rahim was an active
            member of the local shore communities and played a prominent role in
            helping the ship's passengers. He, along with other members, raised some
            $22k to purchase the ship and find a way to evade Canadian policy. Unfortunately,
            while that did not work, his inspiring efforts to fight the discriminatory
            policies then has been forgotten by many.
            <br /><br />

            Aside from this, he lived in Kobe, Japan for 15 years where he was
            known as, "Shagan Lall". He was also the editor for "The Hindustanee
            Newspaper", which was mainly read by the South Asian community
            residing in Vancouver and the lower mainland at the time. He owned a
            bookstore near Strawberry Hill, and is noted to be the first East
            Indian who married in Canada.
            <br /><br />

            A commemorative plaque in Husain Rahim's name is located under the
            Cambie Bridge. Alongside Harnam Kaur Plaza and Khalsa Diwan Road,
            these memorial projects, undertaken by The Nameless Collective in
            collaboration with the City of Vancouver, aim to incorporate Punjabi
            and South Asian history into the cityscape. The plaque's
            inscription, crafted by Paneet Singh, honors Rahim's contributions.

        Born in Bhopal, Barkatullah received his early education in a Madressah

        Early on in his life, he was inspired by the anti imperialist
        campaign of Syed Jamaluddin Afghani.
        <br><br>

        After completing his education, he moved to London where he taught Arabic
        for 8 years. His criticism of British imperial policies did not bode well
        with the British government and he decided to migrate to the USA, where he
        actively participated in Ghaddar Party activities. Like many other revolutionary
        figures of the early twentieth century, Barkatullah traveled extensively
        across Central Asia, Russia, and Europe throughout his life to seek international
        solidarity and support for India's freedom. He was in Tokyo in 1914 when
        he heard about the sailing of the Komagata Maru ship and decided to board
        it.

He traveled from India to Tacoma to Duncan in Vancouver Island, and then to Port Alberni and Boston Bar. He worked in the timber industry, logging, and sawmills. Being the only Muslim person living in Duncan at that time, he was involved in raising funds for a Gurdwara to be built there, as it was the only form of connection he had to the community. At the Duncan Gurdwara, his name is plastered in the main building as a contributor. An interesting point to note is that when the first Islamic Centre was to be built in Vancouver, the Sikhs living there also contributed money towards the funds for construction.
        <br><br>
        As a typical form of migration, families from Boston Bar would move towards the Hope/Chilliwack/Abbotsford area, as did Dan Ali Mohammed. Khalad's grandfather came to Boston Bar sometime in the late 1940s as a young child from India while his great-grandfather was still in Port Alberni. As he grew older, he too worked in sawmills and so.

        Due to the policies set by the Canadian government, South Asian migrants had to typically travel back and forth for getting married and having children.
