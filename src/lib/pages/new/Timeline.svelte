        This interactive timeline showcases key events affecting Muslims in
        British Columbia after 9/11. Navigate through the timeline by clicking
        the arrows on either side or by scrolling horizontally. Each slide
        contains information about a specific event, including dates,
        descriptions, and related media. Click on images to enlarge them. The
        timeline is organized chronologically from left to right, with major
        events highlighted. For the best experience, we recommend viewing one
        slide at a time and reading each event as part of the larger historical
        narrative.
