      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <div>
        Throughout the first half of the twentieth century, the discriminatory
        Canadian immigration policies kept South Asian muslims from migrating to
        Canada. But the shift of policy from “national, ethnic, or racial
        background” to “education and skill level” in 1962 and the “point
        system” in 1967 marked a new moment in the history of South Asian
        muslims immigration to Canada.<sup class="c6"
          ><a href="#ftnt10" id="ftnt_ref10">[10]</a></sup
        >
        Most of the South Asian muslims migrating under this new system belonged
        to a professional and highly educated class.
        <br /><br />
        The growth of the South Asian muslims in the Lower Mainland led to the formation
        of community organizations like Pakistan Canada Association in 1963, and
        British Columbia Muslim Association in 1966. Alongside, more culture focused
        organizations like Lower Mainland Bengali Cultural Society established in
        1979 also involved muslim community members. During the 1980s and 1990s,
        different muslim sects also started building their own mosques, and educational
        centers in B.C. There are 61 mosques spread across BC of these different
        sects.<sup class="c6"><a href="#ftnt11" id="ftnt_ref11">[11]</a></sup>
        <br /><br />
        South Asian muslim migration to B.C during this time period was also influenced
        by events like the exodus of Ismaili communities from East Africa, the formation
        of Bangladesh, the declaration of the Ahmaddiya community as non-muslims
        in Pakistan, the independence of Caribbean states, and a series of coups
        d'état in Fiji. As a result of these events, South Asian muslims from diverse
        sects, geographies, and cultures started migrating to Canada and B.C.
        <br /><br />
        Similarly, during this time period, despite the state's promotion of multicultural
        policies, racism, Islamophobia, and labor exploitation were still rampant
        in the Canadian societies. In order to fight back, Muslim community members
        would often join different organizations.

      <h2>Pakistani</h2>
      <div>
        The Pakistan Canada Association was one of the first South Asian muslim
        organizations in B.C formed in 1963. Muslims from Pakistani Punjab who
        migrated to Canada also shared common cultures, and languages with the
        Punjab Sikh communities of B.C. According to oral history sources, Sikh
        community members also made valuable contributions to the building of
        the first Islamic Centre in Vancouver. During the 1970s, some Pakistani
        community members in Toronto also started publishing their own
        newspapers and magazines in Urdu and English.
        <br /><br />
        Some of the prominent members of this early Pakistani community in B.C included
        Riasat Ali Khan (1934- 2003), HJ Malik, Dr. Aftab Mufti, Nuzhat Amin, Saleem
        Raza (1932-1983), Liaqaut Ali Bajwa (1951-2022), and Zahid Laeeq (1952-2008).
        <br /><br />
        Riasat Ali Khan, who came to Canada in 1959, was a founding member of the
        first mosque in Western Canada in Vancouver, founder of the Pakistan-Canada
        Association and a vocal advocate for multiculturalism. In 1963, he was also
        Canada's only Muslim probation officer. A successful businessman, Mr. Khan
        was active in backroom politics of the Liberal Party in British Columbia
        and tried unsuccessfully to win a federal Liberal nomination in the 1997
        election. He was also a long-time member of the municipal Surrey Electors
        Team. Unfortunately, he was shot to death in 2003 at the age of 69.<sup
          class="c6"><a href="#ftnt12" id="ftnt_ref12">[12]</a></sup
        >
        <br /><br />
        Interviews with Dr. Aftab Mufti, a computer science professor, and Nuzhat
        Amin, a journalist, were conducted in 1974-75 and the interview transcripts
        have been preserved in the Royal BC Museum Archives.
        <br /><br />
        Born in Amritsar as a Christian, Saleem Raza converted to Islam after partition
        and settled in Lahore. He migrated to Vancouver Canada in 1975 and died in
        1983. He was one of the most well known playback singers of Pakistani film
        industry in its early decades.<sup class="c6"
          ><a href="#ftnt13" id="ftnt_ref13">[13]</a></sup
        >
        <br /><br />
        Liaquat Ali Bajwa served as a president of Pakistan Canada Association multiple
        times and was a lifelong trustee of Al Jamia Mosque. He passed away recently
        in 2022.<sup class="c6"><a href="#ftnt14" id="ftnt_ref14">[14]</a></sup>
        <br /><br />
        Lastly, Zahid Laeeq was a well known Urdu poet who came to Canada and B.C
        in 1999/2000. Along with poetry, he also published a multilingual monthly
        magazine Shahpara for eight years. He passed away in 2008.<sup

      <h2>Bengali</h2>
      <div>
        Due to a lack of records about early Bengali migration in B.C, Taraknath
        Das (1884-1958) is one of the few Bengalis who is known to have lived in
        B.C during the early twentieth century. Another well known Bengali who
        set foot in B.C during this time period was the great poet, Rabindaranth
        Tagore (1861-1941), whose visit to Vancouver in April 1929 remains a
        cherished memory for the Bengali community of B.C.
        <br /><br />
        Beyond this early twentieth century time period, it was mostly in 1970's
        that a number of Bengali community members started migrating to Canada. Consequently,
        Bengali organizations started emerging across Canada during this time period.
        In the case of B.C, Lower Mainland Bengali Cultural Society of BC (LMBCS)
        was formed in 1977. Most of its executive members came from a highly educated,
        urban professional class, called <i>bhadralok</i>.<sup class="c6"
          ><a href="#ftnt16" id="ftnt_ref16">[16]</a></sup
        >
        Alongside, Canada Bangladesh Culture Association of B.C was established around
        1988-89, and the Bangladesh Cultural was established in 1992-93.<sup
          class="c6"><a href="#ftnt17" id="ftnt_ref17">[17]</a></sup
        >
        While these Bengali organizations were not overtly Islamic, a number of their
        community participants were muslims.
        <br /><br />
        In 1998, a Bengali community member in Vancouver, Rafiqul Islam (1950-2013),
        established Mother Language Lovers of the World Society, with his fellow
        colleague Abdus Salam. The Society played a significant role in getting 21st
        February declared as International Mother Language Day in 1999.

      <h2>The Caribbean</h2>
      <div>
        From 1838 to 1917, the British colonial government in India sent over
        “500,000” East Indians to the Caribbean countries like Guyana, Trinidad,
        Tobago and Suriname as indentured laborers.<sup class="c6"
          ><a href="#ftnt18" id="ftnt_ref18">[18]</a></sup
        >
        Around “16%” of these indentured laborers were Muslims, most of them belonging
        to North India.<sup class="c6"
          ><a href="#ftnt19" id="ftnt_ref19">[19]</a></sup
        >
        Some of them returned back to India once their indenture contract ended,
        while more than two third East Indians decided to stay in the Caribbean.<sup
          class="c6"><a href="#ftnt20" id="ftnt_ref20">[20]</a></sup
        >
        “Unemployment, poverty, illiteracy, and suicide” was high in the East Indian-Carribean
        communities of late nineteenth century, but they also tried to “restore,
        recreate, and reconsolidate some aspects of their homeland culture.”<sup
          class="c6"><a href="#ftnt21" id="ftnt_ref21">[21]</a></sup
        > After the independence of Caribbean countries in the 1960s, a number of
        these Indo-Caribbean community members including muslims started migrating
        to Canada and B.C.

      <h2>Fiji</h2>
      <div>
        Fiji Muslims constitute another important community of Muslims in B.C
        who trace back their ancestry to South Asia.
        <br /><br />
        Along with the Indo Caribbean Islands, Fiji was another location where East
        Indians were sent as indentured laborers between 1879 and 1920. Within these
        41 years, over “60,553” East Indians were transported to Fijian shores.<sup
          class="c6"><a href="#ftnt22" id="ftnt_ref22">[22]</a></sup
        >
        Around “7,200” of them were muslims.<sup class="c6"
          ><a href="#ftnt23" id="ftnt_ref23">[23]</a></sup
        >
        Because of the miserable living and working conditions, “more suicides occurred
        in Fiji than any other British Colony at the time.”<sup class="c6 c28"
          ><a href="#ftnt24" id="ftnt_ref24">[24]</a></sup
        >
        Over time, Indo-Fijian communities also adapted their religious and cultural
        practices to the new Fijian environment they found themselves in.
        <br /><br />
        After the abolition of indentured labor in 1920, around 60% of Indo Fijians
        decided to stay back in Fiji.<sup class="c6"
          ><a href="#ftnt25" id="ftnt_ref25">[25]</a></sup
        >
        A series of military coups d'état in Fiji between 1987 and 2000 resulted
        in an increased discrimination against Indo Fijian communities, forcing them
        to migrate to countries like Canada.<sup class="c6"

      <h2>East Africa / Ismaili Muslims</h2>
      <div>
        A majority of Ismaili community migrated from the East African countries
        of Uganda, Kenya, and Tanzania to Canada. Most of the community members
        trace their origins back to India/Gujarat. Their traditional practices
        draw from the particular Khoja Ismaili heritage of Western India.<sup
          class="c6"><a href="#ftnt27" id="ftnt_ref27">[27]</a></sup
        >
        <br /><br />
        The migration of Ismaili Muslims from Tanzania and Uganda to Canada in the
        1970s was a result of political instability, discriminatory policies, and
        the quest for a better and secure future. While there was relatively low,
        but consistent migration coming in from the Ismaili population in Tanzania,
        there was a sudden abundance coming in after the implementation of the nationalization
        policies outlined in the Arusha Declaration of 1967. Tanzanians were some
        of the first Ismailis to immigrate to Canada, and hence, were instrumental
        in the founding of the country's first Jamatkhanas/ Prayer Halls. A Jamatkhana
        built in Burnaby in 1985 was the first purpose-built Ismaili jamatkhana and
        the first Ismaili centre in North America. It cost over $10 million.
        <br /><br />
        Alongside, a large number of Ugandan-Asian Ismaili Muslims also started migrating
        to Canada after they were ordered to leave Uganda within 90 days by Idi Amin
        in August 1972. A particularly large community of these East African Ismaili
        Muslims settled in Vancouver and its surrounding areas. During the early
        1970s, the Citizen newspaper of Prince George, welcomed the refugees coming
        in from Uganda.

      <h2>Community Activism</h2>
      <div>
        Despite the Canadian government's promotion of multicultural values
        since 1971, racism against South Asian communities including muslims was
        on the rise in B.C during this time period. They would openly be
        harassed, and beaten on the streets, and their homes would be
        vandalized. Similarly, they would often be underpaid and forced to work
        under miserable conditions. The plans to build mosques in Richmond,
        Edmonton, and Port Coquitlam also initially faced opposition from the
        public and municipal authorities. Lastly, the local newspaper reportings
        would also often pander hatred against South Asian communities and
        muslims.
        <br /><br />
        In the light of these events, South Asian muslim community members often
        joined diverse organizations like Canadian Farmworkers Union (1979-2004),
        Indian People's Association of North America (1973-1995), BC Organization
        to Fight Racism (1973-1990), and BC Muslim Association to resist and fight
        back.
        <br /><br />
        Outside Canada, the events in India during this time period also affected
        the muslim communities of B.C. A conference organized in Vancouver in 1987,
        titled “Centralized State Power and the threat to minorities in India” involved
        active participation of Council of Muslim Communities of Canada, B.C Muslim
        Association, and Canadian Society of Fiji Muslims. Similarly, following the
        attack on Babri Mosque in India in December 1992, Dr. Hari Sharma, a well
        known activist and professor at SFU, formed Non-Resident Indians for Secularism
        and Democracy (NRISAD). One of the aims of NRISAD was to unite South Asian
        people of diverse religions, cultures, histories, and geographies, including
        Muslims, together.<sup class="c6"
          ><a href="#ftnt28" id="ftnt_ref28">[28]</a></sup
        >
        The 50th anniversary of South Asia's independence organized by NRISAD in
        1997 also involved a number of Muslim community organizations.

      <h2>Muslim women</h2>
      <div>
        India Mahila Association was formed in 1973 by a group of Indian women
        to highlight and tackle the issue of domestic violence in South Asian
        communities of B.C. According to one of its press releases, the
        Association consisted of women from Pakistan, Bangladesh, East Africa,
        Fiji, Europe, and India, who were all united in their fight against
        domestic violence.
        <br /><br />
        In 1988, BCMA also established its women's chapter to cater to the needs
        and demands of muslim women.<sup class="c6"
