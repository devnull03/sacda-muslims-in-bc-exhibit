          South Asian Muslims in British Columbia: Introduction
        </h1>

        <p>
          The historical and contemporary presence of Muslim communities in
          Canada has often remained obscured, unacknowledged, and
          misrepresented. Their profound contributions to Canadian society
          warrant deeper appreciation, acknowledgement, and understanding. Our
          research project aims to contribute to this cause by focusing on South
          Asian Muslim communities of B.C. We use archival records, academic
          works, and personal interviews to highlight these, often untold,
          stories of South Asian Muslim communities in B.C.
          <br /><br />
          Far from being a monolithic religion, Islam is a mosaic. Its two main sects
          are Sunni and Shia. Sunni sect is further divided into various sub-sects
          like Wahabi, Salafi, Barelvi, and Deobandi. Shia sect, on the other hand,
          is also divided into further sub sects like Twelver Shi'ism, and Ismailism.
          Other groups like Sufism exist across any such sectarian divisions. Historically,
          Muslim populations have also integrated themselves into diverse local customs,
          cultures, and traditions of Asia, Middle East, and Africa. Our project
          hopes to honor these diverse ways of being a Muslim.
          <br /><br />
          Lastly, we also acknowledge that South Asian Muslims in BC is a first of
          its kind project. We hope that this preliminary project will facilitate
          further, in-depth research projects, and exhibitions in the future. We
          welcome any feedback which can help us improve this project.
