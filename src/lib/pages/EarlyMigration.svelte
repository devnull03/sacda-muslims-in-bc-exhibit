      <div class="">
        Early migration to BC (till 1962, when the immigration policies changed
        to merit/point system)
        <br /><br />
        Due to the lack of archives, we find only small traces of early South Asian
        muslim presence in B.C. For example, a memorandum sent by W.C Hopkinson to
        W.W Cory in 1912 indicates that the small number of muslims living in Vancouver
        at that time raised 900$ and sent it to the “Grand Vizier of Turkey” for
        the “brave soldiers” of the Ottoman empire<sup class="c6"
          ><a href="#ftnt1" id="ftnt_ref1">[1]</a></sup
        >. Similarly, a name, Roum Shah, emerged in a 1914 newspaper clipping of
        The Sun.
        <br /><br />
        When the ship of Komagata Maru landed on the shores of Vancouver in 1914,
        around 24 muslims were estimated to be on board. The well documented story
        of one of these muslim passengers, Barkatullah, indicates how bravely they
        were all fighting against the imperial world order of their times. The Shore
        committee formed to support and collect funds for Komagata Maru passengers
        also included muslim figures like Husain Rahim, and Muhammad Akbar.
        <br /><br />
        Another archived muslim figure of the early twentieth century is Imanat Ali
        Khan who was working in the Fraser Mills at the time of the Komagata Maru
        incident. Lastly, in the Duncan Gurdwara, the name of a Dan Ali Mohammed
        has been plastered for his contributions in building the Gurdwara.

      <h2>Early Muslim migrants / Historical Muslim figures in BC</h2>
      <div>
        <b> Husain Rahim (1865-1937)</b>
        <br />
        Husain Rahim came from a Gujarati Muslim family and came to Canada as a tourist
        in 1910. Five months after his arrival, the immigration department started
        the procedure for deportation against him. However, Rahim fought the case
        and won it in court thereby, remaining in Vancouver.

        <br /><br />
        In 1911, Rahim established the United India League, an organization focused
        on employing constitutional methods to stimulate social and political renewal
        within the Hindustanee populace.
        <br /><br />
        In 1914 when the Komagata Maru incident occurred, Rahim was an active member
        of the local shore communities and played a prominent role in helping the
        ship's passengers. He, along with other members, raised some $22k to purchase
        the ship and find a way to evade Canadian policy. Unfortunately, while that
        did not work, his inspiring efforts to fight the discriminatory policies
        then has been forgotten by many.
        <br /><br />
        Aside from this, he lived in Kobe, Japan for 15 years where he was known
        as, "Shagan Lall". He was also the editor for "The Hindustanee Newspaper",
        which was mainly read by the South Asian community residing in Vancouver
        and the lower mainland at the time. He owned a bookstore near Strawberry
        Hill, and is noted to be the first East Indian who married in Canada.<sup

        <br /><br />
        A commemorative plaque in Husain Rahim's name is located under the Cambie
        Bridge. Alongside Harnam Kaur Plaza and Khalsa Diwan Road, these memorial
        projects, undertaken by The Nameless Collective in collaboration with the
        City of Vancouver, aim to incorporate Punjabi and South Asian history into
        the cityscape. The plaque's inscription, crafted by Paneet Singh, honors
        Rahim's contributions. Resources:

        <b>Imanat Ali Khan (1887-):</b>
        <br />
        Imanat Ali Khan came to Canada at the age of 25 in 1912. He worked in Fraser
        Mills for 2 years, 1912-14, and witnessed the incident of Komagata Maru in
        1914. Khan moved to California after the Mill shut down in 1914. Living in
        Canada and America from 1912 to 1932, Khan went back to India and got married
        there. After living in Pakistan till 1976, Khan came back to California in
        1979 before settling in Canada.

        <b>Barkatullah (1858- 1927):</b>
        <br /> Barkatullah was one of the muslims on the Komagata Maru ship.
        Born in Bhopal, Barkatullah received his early education in a Madressah
        where he learnt "Arabic, Persian and other religious sciences"<sup
          ><a href="#ftnt3" id="ftnt_ref3">[3]</a></sup
        >. Early on in his life, he was inspired by the anti imperialist
        campaign of Syed Jamaluddin Afghani.
        <br /><br />
        After completing his education, he moved to London where he taught Arabic
        for 8 years. His criticism of British imperial policies did not bode well
        with the British government and he decided to migrate to the USA, where he
        actively participated in Ghaddar Party activities. Like many other revolutionary
        figures of the early twentieth century, Barkatullah traveled extensively
        across Central Asia, Russia, and Europe throughout his life to seek international
        solidarity and support for India's freedom. He was in Tokyo in 1914 when
        he heard about the sailing of the Komagata Maru ship and decided to board
        it.

        <br />Muhammed Akbar, son of Mian Alam, a prominent Muslim from the
        Janjua Rajput caste in Gujarat, Punjab (now Pakistan), emerged as a
        pivotal member of the Shore Committee supporting Komagata Maru's
        passengers. Previously affiliated with the Hong Kong police, Akbar
        transitioned into an active role within the Ghadar Party in Vancouver,
        demonstrating sustained commitment post the Komagata Maru incident.<sup

        <b>Dan Ali Muhammad:</b>
        <br />Dan Ali Muhammad was the great grandfather of Khalad, a member of
        the Abbotsford Islamic Centre. Dan came to BC in 1906, even before the
        Komagata Maru incident. He traveled from India to Tacoma to Duncan in
        Vancouver Island, and then to Port Alberni and Boston Bar. He worked in
        the timber industry, logging, and sawmills. Being the only Muslim person
        living in Duncan at that time, he was involved in raising funds for a
        Gurdwara to be built there, as it was the only form of connection he had
        to the community. At the Duncan Gurdwara, his name is plastered in the
        main building as a contributor. An interesting point to note is that
        when the first Islamic Centre was to be built in Vancouver, the Sikhs
        living there also contributed money towards the funds for construction.
        <br /><br />As a typical form of migration, families from Boston Bar
        would move towards the Hope/Chilliwack/Abbotsford area, as did Dan Ali
        Mohammed. Khalad's grandfather came to Boston Bar sometime in the late
        1940s as a young child from India while his great-grandfather was still
        in Port Alberni. As he grew older, he too worked in sawmills and so.
        <br /><br />Due to the policies set by the Canadian government, South
        Asian migrants had to typically travel back and forth for getting
        married and having children.
        <br /><br />Khalad's mother was born in Pakistan and came to BC after
        her marriage. She worked in a government-run nursery in the mountains in
        North Bend at Boston Bar.
        <br /><br />

        <b>Roum Shah:</b>
        <br />There is not a lot of information available about Roum Shah. A
        newspaper clipping from the April 23, 1914 issue of The Sun indicates
        that Roum Shah was the co-author of a pamphlet, “The Tyranny of the
        English Militarism.” He wrote this pamphlet to protest the forceful
        deportation of a prominent Ghaddar Party member, Bhagwan Singh, from
        Vancouver/Victoria to Hong Kong.

      <h2>Ghadar Party</h2>
      <div>
        The Ghadar Party, comprised of Indian expatriates in Canada and the
        United States, was an anti-colonial organization with the objective of
        overthrowing British rule in the Indian subcontinent through armed
        resistance. It established branches worldwide, including in Vancouver,
        BC.<sup><a href="#ftnt5" id="ftnt_ref5">[5]</a></sup> Among its early
        leaders were individuals from the Sikh, Hindu and Muslim communities,
        and its publication prominently featured the names "Ram, Allah, and
        Nanak" on its masthead.<sup><a href="#ftnt6" id="ftnt_ref6">[6]</a></sup
        >
        <br /><br />Academic studies of the movement often focus primarily on
        its secular and socialist aspects, neglecting the diverse religious
        influences that also shaped it. This oversight is particularly evident
        in the case of Muslim Ghadarites, whose religious beliefs are dismissed
        as unrelated to their involvement in the movement.<sup
          ><a href="#ftnt7" id="ftnt_ref7">[7]</a></sup
        >
        Ironically, two prominent Muslim members of the movement, Maulana 'Ubayd
        Allah Sindhi (1872-1944) and Maulana Barkatullah Bhopali (1859-1927) who
        was also a passenger of the Komagata Maru, were esteemed scholars deeply
        rooted in traditional teachings.
        <br /><br />Maulana 'Ubayd Allah Sindhi (1872-1944) stands as a
        significant figure within the Ghadar movement. A Deobandi school of
        thought follower, he embraced anti-imperialist ideals, going beyond
        religion and societal barriers in his hope for India's liberation. He
        was known for his involvement in the 1915 Ghadarite project, Provisional
        Azad Hind Government project in Afghanistan where he became Home
        Minister and Barkatullah as Prime Minister.
        <br /><br />Maulana Barkatullah Bhopali (1859-1927) is known for being
        one of the founding members of the Ghadar Party, and his stays and work
        in Europe, Japan and the Americas. It is worth noting that Barkatullah
        was one of the passengers in the Komagata Maru, however, he was not one
        of the selected passengers who were allowed to stay and so, went to San
        Francisco. Both Barakatullah and Sindhi, along with the majority of
        their Ghadarite members, held onto the idea of Hindu-Muslim unity until
        the very end.<sup><a href="#ftnt8" id="ftnt_ref8">[8]</a></sup>

      <h2>Komagata Maru</h2>
      <div>
        In 1914, a group of 376 people with diverse backgrounds from British
        India were denied entry at the Port of Vancouver by Canadian officials
        due to the discriminatory immigration exclusion laws. Of those 376
        people, only 24 were allowed to remain and the rest were forced to turn
        around and go back, where they were arrested and killed. 337 Sikhs, 27
        Muslims and 12 Hindus were on board.

      <h2>Orientalism</h2>
      <div>
        Edward Said has defined Orientalism as a production of stereotypical
        knowledge about the customs and traditions of the East or Orient since
        at least the "late eighteenth century" in the West.<sup
          ><a href="#ftnt9" id="ftnt_ref9">[9]</a></sup
        >
        <br /><br />
        In the early twentieth century B.C too, we find an interest in plays, novels,
        and articles about the East, or Orient. The December 8, 1906 issue of The
        Victoria Daily Times announced the serial publication of a novel, The Persian
        Roseleaf, written by Col. Andrew Haggard. The novel was based on his experiences
        of fighting battles in Soudan. Similarly, a play titled “Paradise of Mahoment”
        was staged in the Victoria Theatre in October, 1911, after its “successful”
        staging in New York.

        <br /><br />
        Though seemingly harmless and entertaining, these and other similar works
        of Orientalism shaped popular perceptions about Muslims in the early twentieth
        century B.C.
