    Muslim Experiences in Canada / Recent Migration to Canada (Post 9/11)

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <div>
        After a century-long history of migration, the South Asian muslim
        communities constitute a visible and diverse presence in B.C today.
        <br /><br />
        In particular, the emergence of diverse, often dissenting voices from within
        the community has complicated and enriched our understanding of South Asian
        Canadian muslims. On the one hand, minorities within minorities, double diaspora,
        second and third generation muslims, and queer muslims, among others, have
        challenged any one, uniform culture, history, and understanding of the community.
        Alongside, the enigma of reconciling one's Islamic upbringing with the seemingly
        “secular” and “liberal” values of Canadian society has also elicited different
        responses from different members of the community.
        <br /><br />
        The emergence of particular narratives about Muslims in the aftermath of
        9/11 has also affected the community's sense of itself.
        <br /><br />
        Lastly, a number of recent ethnographic works also highlight the difficulties
        South Asian muslim migrants face in finding employment due to the lack of
        Canadian education and work experience.

      <h2>Post 9/11</h2>
      <div>
        9/11 marked a very difficult and challenging time for the Muslim
        communities of North America. They experienced increased surveillance,
        threat calls, and discrimination at both the state level and everyday
        social life in the aftermath of 9/11. The community members had to
        repeatedly prove themselves as “non-extremists”, and “non-threatening”
        in various social situations especially at airports.

      <h2>Muslim Queerness</h2>
      <div>
        Itrath Syed, a former BCMA member, faced backlash from community members
        for her support of the same sex marriage during her election campaigns
        in 2004.<sup class="c6"><a href="#ftnt30" id="ftnt_ref30">[30]</a></sup>
        More recently, a number of community members participated in “Million March
        4 Children” to protest against sexual orientation and Gender identity (SOGI)
        curriculum in schools.<sup class="c6"
          ><a href="#ftnt31" id="ftnt_ref31">[31]</a></sup
        >
        These incidents indicate the precarity of queer South Asian muslims within
        the community.
        <br /><br />
        With the legalization of same-sex marriage in 2005, organizations like Trikone
        Vancouver, Sher Vancouver, and Salaam Queer Muslim community emerged to offer
        support to queer South Asian communities in B.C. El-Farouk Khaki, Imtiaz
        Popat, and Fatima Jaffer are the three well known South Asian muslim queer
        activists.

      <h2>Bengali</h2>
      <div>
        Recently, Bengali organizations in B.C have started regularly organizing
        events like West Coast Tagore Festival, International Mother language
        Festival, Pitha Utsav (festival of Bangladeshi pancakes, desserts), and
        Vaisakhi Mela (Bengali New Year celebration). These events are well-
        attended by Bengali community members of various religions, and
        nationalities, including Muslims.<sup class="c6"

      <h2>Sri Lanka</h2>
      <div>
        Sri Lanka's diverse Muslim community counts up to 9.7% of the total
        population. While the majority of the Muslims are Sunni, there are
        communities of those who follow Sufism. The beginnings of the Muslim
        population in Sri Lanka can be linked to the ancient trade paths
        connecting South and Southeast Asia with the Middle East. In the seventh
        century, traders from the Middle East (Arabs and Persians) established
        commercial connections in southern India that also extended to Sri
        Lanka. Middle Eastern traders wed Tamil and Sinhalese women and
        established roots in the eastern region of the island near Batticaloa
        and Ampara. Tuan Burhanuddin Jayah is seen as one of the national heroes
        of Sri Lanka and was the first Muslim cabinet minister in 1948.<sup

      <h2>Ahmadiyya</h2>
      <div>
        Most of the Ahmadiyya community members in B.C consist of refugees and
        immigrants from Pakistan's Punjab region. A large number of community
        members have migrated to Canada to escape religious persecution
        especially after 1974 when they were declared non-muslims in Pakistan.
        Baitur Rehman Mosque was built in 2005 to fulfill the religious needs of
        the community. The community has also actively developed relationships
        with Indigenous communities of B.C.<sup class="c6"
          ><a href="#ftnt34" id="ftnt_ref34">[34]</a></sup
        >
        Lastly, the community also organizes the annual World Religions Conference
        across B.C.<sup class="c6"

      <h2>Shia</h2>
      <div>
        As the recent work of Waged Jafer indicates, the historical narrative of
        Imam Hussain guides the self understanding of the Shia community in
        Vancouver. Amidst a predominantly Sunni Muslim presence in Canada, Shia
        community members often find themselves as a minority within a minority.
        Within this diasporic context, they actively “resist marginalization,
        seek equal recognition and equal participation” by mourning and
        remembering the story of Imam Hussain.<sup class="c6"
          ><a href="#ftnt36" id="ftnt_ref36">[36]</a></sup
        >
        <br /><br />
        Shia Muslim Community of British Columbia (SMCBC) is the largest organization
        of the community in B.C.<sup class="c6"
          ><a href="#ftnt37" id="ftnt_ref37">[37]</a></sup
        > In 2002, the organization opened Az-Zahra Islamic Centre, which caters
        to the “spiritual, social, educational, and economic well being” of the community.

      <div>
        With an increased understanding of how the intertwined histories of
        colonialism, migration, and racism have affected South Asian muslim
        communities of B.C, a number of community members have also started
        developing relationships of solidarity and allyship with Indigenous
        communities of B.C.<sup class="c6"
